\
## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION\
This document contains the CORE data model, business logic, and calculation formulas for the VueSense portfolio management system. The AI MUST understand ALL of this before attempting to answer ANY questions.\
\
---\
\
## CREDITS AND GENESIS\
\
### Primary Architect\
**Chris Spagnuolo** is the primary architect of the entire VueSense application, including all scoring systems, team health models, dashboards, and AI prompts.\
\
- Website: https://www.chrisspagnuolo.info/\
- LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/chrisspagnuolo\
\
### Model Genesis\
This model began as a thought experiment at Riot Games with:\
- A\'f0alsteinn "Alli" \'d3ttarsson\
- Richard Hensley  \
- Michael Robillard\
\
Richard and Michael provided systems thinking skills to refine the flow of the model and the work items. It all started as post-it notes that Alli put up on a whitboard in a small conference room in Santa Monica.\
\
### Evolution\
The model has undergone many changes and evolved as Chris implemented it at numerous clients including:\
- HealtheSystems\
- Jackson Hewitt\
- Deloitte\
- PwC\
- Wander Maps\
- And many others\
\
After years of refinement of a very analog system, in 2025 Chris finally put everything he has learned into this app and the AI that supports it. It will continue to evolve and grow as we learn more about using it.\

\
## 1. DATA MODEL & CORE CONCEPTS\
\
### 1.1 TEAMS\
Teams are the fundamental delivery units. Each team has:\
\
**6 Health Dimensions** (4-state system):\
- **Capacity**: Team's bandwidth to take on work\
  - Healthy (Green): Team has capacity\
  - At Risk (Yellow/Orange): Team is stretched\
  - Critical (Red): Team is overloaded\
  - Not Set (Gray): No data\
  \
- **Skillset**: Technical capabilities needed\
  - Healthy: Has all required skills\
  - At Risk: Missing some skills\
  - Critical: Severe skill gaps\
  - Not Set: No assessment\
  \
- **Vision**: Clarity of direction and goals\
  - Healthy: Clear vision and alignment\
  - At Risk: Some confusion\
  - Critical: No clear direction\
  - Not Set: No assessment\
  \
- **Support**: Tools, resources, org backing\
  - Healthy: Well-supported\
  - At Risk: Some support gaps\
  - Critical: Severely under-resourced\
  - Not Set: No assessment\
  \
- **Team Cohesion** (Teamwork): Collaboration quality\
  - Healthy: Strong collaboration\
  - At Risk: Some friction\
  - Critical: Serious dysfunction\
  - Not Set: No assessment\
  \
- **Autonomy**: Decision-making independence\
  - Healthy: Can self-direct\
  - At Risk: Some blocking dependencies\
  - Critical: Constantly blocked\
  - Not Set: No assessment\
\
**Additional Team Metrics**:\
- **Utilization**: Percentage of capacity used (0-100%)\
  - Over 95% = Overloaded (critical risk)\
  - 70-95% = Healthy range\
  - Under 50% = Underutilized\
  \
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint\
- **Active Stories**: Number of current work items\
- **Flagged/Blocked Stories**: Items with impediments\
- **Blockers**: Critical impediments\
- **Comments**: Text notes about team status\
\
**Team Health Levels** (Overall):\
- **Healthy**: 0 dimensions at-risk or critical\
- **Low Risk**: 1-2 dimensions at-risk or critical\
- **High Risk**: 3-4 dimensions at-risk or critical  \
- **Critical**: 5-6 dimensions at-risk or critical\
\

\
### 1.2 INITIATIVES\
Initiatives are the work efforts that teams execute on.\
\
**Initiative Types**:\
- **Strategic** (Blue): Core business value initiatives explicitly solving customer problems, defined by product strategy\
- **KTLO** (Yellow): Keep-The-Lights-On operational work, tech debt, platform maintenance\
- **Emergent** (Purple): Unplanned critical work, significant business/customer needs\
\
**Validation Status**:\
- **not-validated** (Red dot): Assumptions untested, high risk\
- **in-validation** (Teal dot): Currently running experiments\
- **validated** (Green dot): All hypotheses confirmed, ready to build\
\
**Priority System**:\
- **1-15**: Above the Mendoza Line (deliverable work)\
- **16+**: Below the Mendoza Line (backlog, cannot deliver with current capacity)\
- **bullpen**: Pipeline (future work not yet prioritized)\
\
**Data Fields**:\
- id (unique identifier)\
- title/name\
- type (strategic/KTLO/emergent)\
- validation status\
- priority (number or "bullpen")\
- progress (0-100%)\
- teams (array of team names)\
- stories count\
- flagged count (blocked/impediment stories)\
- blockers\
- activity type (development, research, compliance, etc.)\
- canvas data (outcome, customer, problem, solution, etc.)\
\
---\
\
### 1.3 THE MENDOZA LINE CONCEPT\
**Critical Portfolio Concept:**\
\
The Mendoza Line (named after baseball player Mario Mendoza's batting incompetence threshold) is the divider between:\
- **Above the Line (Rows 1-5)**: Work we CAN deliver with current capacity\
- **Below the Line (Rows 6+)**: Work we CANNOT deliver with current capacity\
\
**Strategic Implications**:\
- Expensive work (development, infrastructure, integration) below the line = WASTE\
- Discovery work (research, validation, prototyping) SHOULD be below the line (validate before committing)\
- Line position based on historical delivery capacity\
- Line should move UP as organizational constraints grow\
- Teams can accept NO additional work when capacity indicators turn red\
\
**Visual Representation**:\
- Red dotted line between rows (typically rows 5 and 6)\
- Above = active deliverable work\
- Below = backlog/discovery/future work\
\

\
## 2. SCORING MODELS & CALCULATIONS\
\
### 2.1 INITIATIVE RISK SCORING\
**Each initiative gets a risk score from multiple factors:**\
\
**Team Health Risk Points** (for each team assigned):\
- **Capacity**:\
  - At Risk = 3 points\
  - Critical = 6 points\
  \
- **Skillset**:\
  - At Risk = 3 points\
  - Critical = 6 points\
  \
- **Support**:\
  - At Risk = 2 points\
  - Critical = 4 points\
  \
- **Vision**:\
  - At Risk = 1 point\
  - Critical = 2 points\
  \
- **Team Cohesion/Teamwork**:\
  - At Risk = 1 point\
  - Critical = 2 points\
  \
- **Autonomy**:\
  - At Risk = 1 point\
  - Critical = 2 points\
  \
- **Over-Utilization** (>95% capacity): 2 points per team\
\
**Flagged Work Points** (based on percentage of flagged stories):\
- 50%+ flagged = 8 points\
- 25-49% flagged = 5 points\
- 15-24% flagged = 3 points\
- 5-14% flagged = 2 points\
- 1-4% flagged = 1 point\
\
**Validation Risk Points** (Above-the-line ONLY, priority 1-15):\
- Strategic not-validated = 2 points\
- KTLO/Emergent not-validated = 1 point\
- Below-the-line or validated = 0 points\
\
**Priority Amplification**:\
- IF priority \uc0\u8804  10 (row 1-2) AND base risk score > 4: ADD 1 point\
- (Top priorities with existing risk factors get extra scrutiny)\
\
**Risk Severity Levels**:\
- **0-3 points**: Low Risk (Green)\
- **4-7 points**: Medium Risk (Yellow)\
- **8-11 points**: High Risk (Orange)  \
- **12+ points**: Critical Risk (Red)\
\
**Maximum Possible Score**: 50 points (though rarely achieved)\
\
---\
\
### 2.2 DELIVERY CONFIDENCE SCORING\
**Starts at 90%, adjusted by risk factors:**\
\
**ABOVE THE LINE (Full Weight) - Rows 1-5**:\
- Capacity risks: -4% per team at-risk or critical\
- Skillset risks: -3% per team at-risk or critical\
- Blocked work: -0.5% per blocked item (maximum -15% total)\
- Stagnant work (<25% progress): -3% per stagnant initiative\
- Support risks: -2% per team at-risk or critical\
\
**BELOW THE LINE (50% Reduced Weight) - Rows 6+**:\
- Capacity risks: -2% per team at-risk or critical (50% of above-line penalty)\
- Skillset risks: -1.5% per team at-risk or critical (50% of above-line penalty)\
\
**DISTRACTION PENALTY** (All initiatives below the line):\
- -2% for every 3 active initiatives below the line\
- Rationale: Resources not focused on deliverable priorities\
\
**FOCUS BONUS** (Rewards concentration):\
- +3% for ZERO active work below line (perfect focus)\
- +2% for \uc0\u8804 2 active initiatives below line (good focus)\
- +1% for \uc0\u8804 4 active initiatives below line (decent focus)\
\
**OVER-UTILIZATION PENALTY** (Applies to ALL teams, regardless of line):\
- -2% per team over 95% capacity utilization\
\
**Final Range**: 40% to 100%\
\
**Confidence Zones**:\
- 85-100%: Excellent (Green)\
- 70-84%: Good (Blue)\
- 55-69%: Fair/At Risk (Orange)\
- 40-54%: Poor/Critical (Red)\
\
---\
\
### 2.3 RESOURCE EFFICIENCY SCORING\
\
**Activity Type Weights & Ideal Placement**:\
\
**Expensive Work** (Weight: 3.0):\
- Types: Development, Integration, Infrastructure, Defects/Fixes, Go-to-Market\
- SHOULD be: Above Mendoza Line\
- Rationale: High-cost work below line = pure waste\
\
**Discovery Work** (Weight: 1.5):\
- Types: Research, Prototyping, Validation, Experimentation\
- SHOULD be: Below Mendoza Line\
- Rationale: Validate before committing expensive resources\
\
**Support Work** (Weight: 0.5):\
- Types: Compliance, Documentation, Operational Support\
- Placement: Either position acceptable\
- Rationale: Lower strategic impact, necessary regardless\
\
**Calculation Formula**:\
\\`\\`\\`\
Efficiency Score = (Actual Weighted Score / Maximum Possible Score) \'d7 100\
\
Where:\
- Expensive work ABOVE line = Full points (weight \'d7 count)\
- Expensive work BELOW line = Zero points (pure waste)\
- Discovery work BELOW line = Full points (weight \'d7 count)\
- Discovery work ABOVE line = Partial credit (weight \'d7 count \'d7 0.6)\
- Support work = Full points regardless of position\
\\`\\`\\`\
\
**Efficiency Thresholds**:\
- **85%+**: Excellent allocation (Green)\
- **75-84%**: Good allocation (Blue)\
- **60-74%**: Fair allocation, needs optimization (Orange)\
- **<60%**: Poor allocation, major waste (Red)\
\
**Example Calculation**:\
If portfolio has:\
- 5 expensive initiatives above line = 5 \'d7 3.0 = 15 points\
- 2 expensive initiatives below line = 0 points (waste!)\
- 3 discovery initiatives below line = 3 \'d7 1.5 = 4.5 points\
- 1 discovery initiative above line = 1 \'d7 1.5 \'d7 0.6 = 0.9 points\
- 2 support initiatives (any position) = 2 \'d7 0.5 = 1.0 point\
\
Actual Score = 15 + 0 + 4.5 + 0.9 + 1.0 = 21.4 points\
Max Possible = (7 \'d7 3.0) + (4 \'d7 1.5) + (2 \'d7 0.5) = 21 + 6 + 1 = 28 points\
Efficiency = (21.4 / 28) \'d7 100 = 76% (Good)\

## 3. DATA ACCESS PATTERNS\
\
### 3.1 Accessing Portfolio Data\
All data is stored in: \\`window.boardData\\`\
\
**Structure**:\
\\`\\`\\`javascript\
window.boardData = \{\
  initiatives: [...],  // Array of initiative objects\
  teams: \{...\},        // Object with team names as keys\
  bullpen: [...],      // Pipeline initiatives\
  okrs: \{...\}          // OKR data with key results\
\}\
\\`\\`\\`\
\
### 3.2 Common Data Queries\
\
**Get all initiatives**:\
\\`window.boardData.initiatives\\`\
\
**Get initiatives above Mendoza line**:\
\\`window.boardData.initiatives.filter(i => i.priority >= 1 && i.priority <= 15)\\`\
\
**Get initiatives below Mendoza line**:\
\\`window.boardData.initiatives.filter(i => i.priority >= 16)\\`\
\
**Get bullpen/pipeline**:\
\\`window.boardData.bullpen\\`\
\
**Get specific team**:\
\\`window.boardData.teams['Team Name']\\`\
\
**Get team health for initiative**:\
For each team in initiative.teams array, check:\
\\`window.boardData.teams[teamName].capacity\\` (healthy/at-risk/critical/not-set)\
\\`window.boardData.teams[teamName].skillset\\`\
etc.\
