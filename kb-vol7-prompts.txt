\f0\fs24 \cf0 # VOLUME 7: WHAT-IF PROMPT RECOGNITION PATTERNS\
\
## CRITICAL: FLEXIBLE LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING\
\
Users will NEVER use the exact same phrasing. The AI must recognize intent from different terminology, casual vs formal language, and implicit vs explicit requests.\
\
## TERMINOLOGY TRANSLATION TABLE\
\
Users may use different terms. AI must recognize ALL variations:\
\
| User Says | AI Understands As |\
|-----------|-------------------|\
| "row 3", "line 3", "third row", "third line" | Row 3 (slots 4-6) |\
| "slot 6", "position 6", "priority 6", "spot 6" | Slot 6 |\
| "above the line", "above Mendoza", "in delivery range", "active work" | Slots 1-15, Rows 1-5 |\
| "below the line", "below Mendoza", "backlog", "future work" | Slots 16+, Rows 6-8 |\
| "move up", "promote", "higher priority", "bump up" | Decrease slot number |\
| "move down", "demote", "lower priority", "bump down" | Increase slot number |\
| "top 10", "first 10", "highest 10" | Slots 1-10 |\
| "pipeline", "backlog", "bullpen", "queue", "waiting" | Inactive initiatives |\
| "board", "active", "live", "in-flight", "current" | Active initiatives |\
| "teams", "resources", "people", "capacity", "engineering" | Teams |\

\
---\
\
## DISAMBIGUATION STRATEGIES\
\
When user query is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions:\
\
### Ambiguity Type 1: Row vs Slot Confusion\
**User**: "Move Data Lake to 3"\
**AI Asks**: "Do you mean Row 3 (slots 4-6) or slot 3 (Row 2)?"\
\
### Ambiguity Type 2: Unclear Target Position in Row\
**User**: "Move Data Lake to row 3"\
**AI Response**: "Row 3 has three slots (4, 5, 6). I'll assume you mean slot 6 (highest priority in that row) unless you specify otherwise."\
\
### Ambiguity Type 3: Multiple Initiatives with Similar Names\
**User**: "Move the Data initiative higher"\
**AI Asks**: "I see 'Data Lake v2' and 'Data Platform Upgrade'. Which one did you mean?"\
\
### Ambiguity Type 4: Unclear Team Reference\
**User**: "Move the backend team to Data Lake"\
**AI Asks**: "I see 'Backend Platform' and 'Backend Services'. Which team did you mean?"\
\
### Ambiguity Type 5: Timeframe Unclear\
**User**: "What if Data Lake completes soon?"\
**AI Asks**: "What timeline are you considering? Next month? Next quarter? This helps me calculate capacity planning."\
\
---\
\
## CONTEXT CLUES FOR INTENT RECOGNITION\
\
### Clue 1: Question vs Statement\
- **Question form** ("What if...?", "What happens...?") \uc0\u8594  Analysis request\
- **Statement form** ("Move Data Lake to row 3") \uc0\u8594  Implies "analyze this move"\
\
### Clue 2: Tense Usage\
- **Conditional tense** ("would", "could", "might") \uc0\u8594  Hypothetical analysis\
- **Future tense** ("will", "when", "after") \uc0\u8594  Planning scenario\
- **Present tense** ("move", "change", "add") \uc0\u8594  Immediate consideration\
\
### Clue 3: Focus Keywords\
- **"What frees up"**, **"capacity"**, **"available"** \uc0\u8594  Emphasize team/resource impact\
- **"Risk"**, **"impact"**, **"implications"** \uc0\u8594  Emphasize risk calculation\
- **"Should we"**, **"is it worth"**, **"good idea"** \uc0\u8594  Require recommendation\
- **"How"**, **"what's the best way"** \uc0\u8594  Optimization request, may need options\
\
### Clue 4: Urgency Indicators\
- **"Should we"**, **"need to decide"** \uc0\u8594  Requires clear recommendation\
- **"Just curious"**, **"wondering"** \uc0\u8594  Informational, less pressure\
- **"ASAP"**, **"urgently"**, **"critical"** \uc0\u8594  Highlight time-sensitive impacts\
\
---\
\
## CRITICAL RESPONSE RULES\
\
1. **Always report BOTH slot AND row changes**: "slot 15 (Row 5) \uc0\u8594  slot 16 (Row 6)"\
2. **Only report RELEVANT initiatives**: Directly displaced, row changes, Mendoza crossings\
3. **Highlight Mendoza crossings prominently**: Use \uc0\u9888 \u65039  or \u55357 \u57000  for crossing the line\
4. **Calculate ALL metric changes**: Risk scores, efficiency, delivery confidence\
5. **Give actionable recommendations**: Don't just analyze, guide decisions\
6. **Show your work**: Explain WHY metrics changed\
7. **Match user's tone**: Casual query = casual response, formal query = detailed analysis\
8. **Default to slot 6 when user says "row 3"**: Assume rightmost (highest priority) position\
9. **Never make up data**: Only reference initiatives and teams that exist in the portfolio\
10. **Use specific names**: Never say "some teams" or "several initiatives"\
