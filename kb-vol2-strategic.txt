\
## STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK INTRODUCTION\
\
### The Four Meta-Components\
\
Portfolio and product planning is the process of deciding where to invest, how much, and ensuring that products deliver on customer problems AND business objectives.\
\
**The four interconnected meta-components:**\
\
1. **Cascading OKRs**: Alignment of goals from executive level down through all teams\
2. **Opportunity Solution Tree**: Mapping from outcomes to validated solutions\
3. **Opportunity Validation**: Testing assumptions before committing resources\
4. **Portfolio Prioritization**: Stack-ranking and visualizing work with team health\
\
These components work together in a non-linear, continuous learning feedback loop.\
\
### Portfolio Review Goals\
\
On a regular basis, review the portfolio to:\
- Maximize portfolio value over time\
- Ensure portfolio is balanced and diversified (risk, duration, timing, technologies)\
- Consider constraints of people and expertise\
- Make best use of available resources\
- Maintain holistic view across products, services, business units\
\
---\
\
## 1. CASCADING OKRs (OBJECTIVES AND KEY RESULTS)\
\
### 1.1 OKR Structure\
\
**Objective**: Qualitative, inspiring, ambitious goal\
**Key Results**: 3-5 quantitative, measurable outcomes with timeboxes\
\
**Example (Football Team)**:\
- Objective: "Dominate the league"\
- KR1: Win 1 Super Bowl\
- KR2: Increase average attendance to 98%\
\
### 1.2 OKR Cascade Process\
\
1. **Executive Level**: Sets top-level organizational OKRs\
2. **Next-Level Business Units**: Create aligned OKRs that support top-level\
3. **Team Level**: Each team creates OKRs aligned to their business unit\
4. **Individual Level** (optional): Personal OKRs aligned to team\
\
**Critical Rule**: Each level's OKRs must directly contribute to the level above.\
\
**Football Team Example - Complete Cascade**:\
\
**Executive Level**:\
- Objective: "Be the top revenue generating franchise in the NFL"\
- KR1: Win 1 Super Bowl\
- KR2: Increase average attendance to 98%\
\
**Head Coach (Next Level)**:\
- Objective: "Have a winning season"\
- KR1: Average 200 yards passing per game\
- KR2: Give up less than 14 points per game\
- KR3: 25 yard punt return average\
\
**Offensive Coordinator (Team Level)**:\
- Objective: "Have the best passing game in the league"\
- KR1: Have a 75% completion rate\
- KR2: Give up less than 1 sack per game\
- KR3: Average 200 yards receiving per game\
\
**Defensive Coordinator (Team Level)**:\
- Objective: "Never let them score!"\
- KR1: Keep opponents to less than 100 yards passing\
- KR2: Keep opponents to less than 75 yards rushing\
- KR3: Average 2 sacks per game\
\
**Special Teams (Team Level)**:\
- Objective: "Big returns baby!"\
- KR1: Zero fair catches per game\
- KR2: Zero return penalties per game\
- KR3: Average return >25 yards per game\
\
**Public Relations (Alternative Business Unit)**:\
- Objective: "Fill the stadium every Sunday"\
- KR1: Increase national media coverage by 60%\
- KR2: Highlight key players 1 time/day in local media\
- KR3: Increase social media engagement by 45%\
\
### 1.3 OKR Grading Scale\
\
Score key results on 0-1.0 scale:\
- **1.0** = Sandbagged (too easy, set harder next time)\
- **0.6-0.7** = Ideal (stretch goal achieved)\
- **Below 0.6** = Missed target (learn why)\
\
**Example**: If KR was "increase signups by 10,000" and you got 6,200:\
- Grade = 0.62 (missed target, but close)\
\
**Important**: Scores should NEVER be used for:\
- Team or personal evaluation\
- Punishment\
- Compensation or bonuses\
\
**Low scores are NOT failures** - they're learning opportunities to:\
- Evaluate if objective is still worth pursuing\
- Rethink the objective\
- Figure out different approaches for next time\
\
### 1.4 OKR Timing & Cadences\
\
**Quarterly Cadence** (Standard):\
- Shorter than quarterly = too tactical (becomes epics/stories)\
- Longer than quarterly = lacks agility, causes whiplash\
\
**Day-to-Day Cadence**:\
- Align ALL work to OKRs (opportunities, epics, stories)\
- State which OKR each item relates to and expected impact\
- Prioritize work by impact on advancing OKRs\
- Challenge non-aligned work respectfully\
- Focus on OKR metrics instead of process metrics\
- Help each other meet goals and stay on track\
\
**Weekly Cadence**:\
- Check progress toward OKR target (PUSH)\
- Set team's intention for the week (PLAN)\
- Forecast big impediments for the month (PIPELINE)\
- Check health metrics (PROTECT)\
- Celebrate! Friday win sessions to demo progress\
\
**Quarterly Cadence**:\
- Grade your OKRs\
- Review hits and misses\
- Assess learnings\
- Build next quarter's OKRs\
- All Hands Meeting to Celebrate:\
  - Review previous OKRs and progress\
  - Share grades, results, adjustments\
  - Announce next quarter's top-level OKRs\
\
**ALWAYS Cadence**:\
- Enhance collaboration using OKRs\
- Focus communication around advancing shared OKRs\
- Put personal agendas and pet projects into perspective\
- Stay positive and always learn from experiences\
\
### 1.5 OKR Failure Modes to Avoid\
\
- Lack of cultural commitment (everyone should know top-level OKR)\
- Too many OKRs (causes lack of focus)\
- Using OKRs for performance evaluation or compensation\
- Metric-driven objectives (keep metrics in key results)\
- Changing OKRs mid-stream (causes organizational whiplash)\
- Sandbagging (setting easy targets)\
- Letting projects/tasks become objectives\
- Lack of regular tracking and assessment\
- Using as status report instead of conversation starter\
- Organizational blinders to why goals aren't being met\
\
### 1.6 Benefits of OKRs\
\
- **Alignment**: High alignment to top-level strategic goals across entire organization\
- **Focus**: Eliminates waste by reducing non-strategic work\
- **Commitment**: High visibility drives commitment\
- **Tracking**: Ensures impediment removal\
- **Stretching**: Drives amazing results by setting stretch goals\
\

\
## 2. THE FOUR SQUARE FRAMEWORK\
\
### 2.1 Four Square Structure\
\
A weekly execution tool with four quadrants:\
\
**PUSH (Top Left)**: OKRs and Confidence\
- State your OKR\
- Confidence level (1-10 scale) for each key result\
- Drives discussion on why you will/won't reach objective\
- Review weekly: Are we closer or further from the result?\
- Rate confidence in achieving EACH key result EVERY week\
- If confidence goes up or down, know why and what changed\
- Helps learn as we go along\
\
**PLAN (Top Right)**: Weekly Tactics\
- P1 = Must do this week\
- P2 = Should do this week\
- Hypotheses for moving key results\
- Tactics to achieve the OKR\
- Think of items as hypotheses around HOW to move key results\
\
**PROTECT (Bottom Left)**: Health Metrics\
- Customer satisfaction\
- Team health  \
- Code health\
- Sustainable pace\
- Things to protect while pursuing OKRs\
- The things we want to PROTECT as we go after our big goals\
- When starting, ask "Where should we set these today to start?"\
- Metrics should be baselined and tracked like OKR metrics\
\
**PIPELINE (Bottom Right)**: Next 4 Weeks\
- BIG upcoming items\
- Heads up / important-urgent items\
- Allows honest conversations about ability to achieve objectives\
- Things coming up that can get in the way of reaching objective\
- While we may not be able to do anything about pipeline items, allows honest conversation with broader org about ability to achieve objectives\
\
### 2.2 Four Square Cadence\
\
- **Weekly reviews**: 30 minutes per week per team\
- Attendees: All stakeholders specific to the OKR\
- Update confidence levels on each KR\
- Discuss upcoming tactics\
- Review and address protect quadrant issues\
- Review and update pipeline events\
\
**NOT a status report - it's a CONVERSATION STARTER**\
\
### 2.3 Four Square Key Questions\
\
The Four Square should drive conversations within teams:\
- Do our tactical priorities lead to hitting our OKR target?\
- Why is confidence dropping? What can we do to help?\
- Are we prepared for major new efforts?\
- Is crap making it into our code base?\
- Are our teams healthy and able to do the work?\
\
### 2.4 Four Square Best Practices\
\
- Store Four Squares in highly visible location (anyone can view anytime)\
- Accountability and high-level planning on regular basis\
- Focus on learning and adaptation\
- Use for honest conversation, not blame\
\
---\
\
## 3. OPPORTUNITY SOLUTION TREE\
\
### 3.1 OST Purpose\
\
Map from desired outcomes (OKRs) to validated solutions through opportunities and experiments.\
\
**Key Principle**: \
- Start with problem, not solution\
- Multiple solutions per opportunity\
- Test before committing resources\
\
### 3.2 OST Structure (4 Levels)\
\
1. **Desired Outcome** (Top) - From OKRs\
2. **Opportunities** - Problems to solve\
3. **Solutions** - Ways to solve problems\
4. **Experiments** - Tests to validate solutions\
\
**Visual Flow**:\
Outcome \uc0\u8594  Branches to multiple Opportunities \u8594  Each Opportunity branches to multiple Solutions \u8594  Each Solution branches to multiple Experiments\
\
### 3.3 OST Process (4 Steps)\
\
**Step 1**: Define desired outcome from OKR\
**Step 2**: Discover opportunities through continuous customer interviews and research\
**Step 3**: Generate multiple solution ideas for each opportunity\
**Step 4**: Design experiments to test assumptions for each solution\
\
### 3.4 Continuous Discovery\
\
**Teresa Torres' Framework**:\
- Engage in generative research to identify compelling opportunities\
- Always entertain new solutions\
- Run experiments every week\
- Connect all activities using OST structure\
\
### 3.5 OST Failure Modes to Avoid\
\
- Too many ideas (causes analysis paralysis)\
- No clear prioritization of opportunities or solutions\
- Orphaned solutions (don't connect to opportunities or outcomes)\
- Fixating on one opportunity, one solution, one experiment at a time\
- Considering far too many opportunities, solutions, experiments at once\
- Yes, it's a Goldilocks scenario - need right balance between depth and breadth\
- "Whether or not to do this specific thing" decisions (avoid binary thinking - consider multiple options at every decision point)\
- Discovery without delivery (discovery has to lead to delivery)\
\
### 3.6 OST Key Questions (Continuous Assessment)\
\
- Does your team have a clear desired outcome?\
- Are you engaging in generative research to identify compelling opportunities in the market?\
- Are you always entertaining new solutions?\
- Are you running experiments every week?\
- Can you connect the dots between all these activities using this structure?\
\

\
## 4. OPPORTUNITY VALIDATION\
\
### 4.1 Validation Purpose\
\
Must test assumptions before committing resources to development. Validation reduces risk and ensures we're building the right thing.\
\
### 4.2 Scientific Method for Validation\
\
1. Define your hypotheses\
2. Define your assumptions\
3. Select the riskiest assumption\
4. Develop an experiment to test it\
5. State minimum criteria for validation\
6. Run experiment with existing/potential customers\
7. Document learnings\
8. Pivot hypotheses based on learnings\
9. Rinse and repeat until all hypotheses validated\
\
### 4.3 Three Hypotheses to Validate\
\
1. **Customer Hypothesis**: Who wants this?\
2. **Problem Hypothesis**: What problem exists?\
3. **Solution Hypothesis**: Does our solution work?\
\
### 4.4 Validation Board\
\
Use LeanStartupMachine's Validation Board:\
- Simple one-page visualization\
- Easy to use and consume\
- Share across organization for transparency\
\
**Tracks**:\
- Hypotheses\
- Riskiest Assumption\
- Method (experiment design)\
- Results\
- Validated/Invalidated status\
\
### 4.5 Validation Timing\
\
- Continuous process\
- Each validation effort: 1-2 weeks (depending on problem/experiment type)\
- Desired outcome: Validated customer, problem, solution compiled into Initiative Canvas\
\
### 4.6 Validation Status Meanings (in Portfolio Board)\
\
- **Not Validated** (Red dot): Assumptions untested - HIGH RISK\
- **In Validation** (Teal dot): Currently running experiments\
- **Validated** (Green dot): All hypotheses confirmed - LOW RISK, ready to build\
\
**Rule for Portfolio**: First 3 rows should be fully validated and ready to work.\
\
---\
\
## 5. INITIATIVE CANVAS\
\
### 5.1 Purpose\
\
When opportunity and solution are validated, capture learnings in a simple one-page document to communicate validated conclusions.\
\
### 5.2 Nine Key Questions\
\
1. **What is the desired outcome?**\
   - From Opportunity Solution Tree\
   - The overarching goal of this opportunity\
\
2. **What are the measures of success?**\
   - Specific measurable metrics to determine if goal has been met\
   - Set a target value\
\
3. **How big is this opportunity?**\
   - What is the addressable market size?\
\
4. **Who wants this?**\
   - Target customer (be as specific as possible)\
   - May be more than one customer segment\
   - Validated personas are a great way to describe target group\
\
5. **What problem are we solving?**\
   - Simply stated, do we solve if we deliver this to our customers?\
   - Think about from customer perspective, not our perspective\
\
6. **What is the possible solution?**\
   - Validated solution idea\
   - Can be more than one (because you wrote it there, doesn't mean this is THE solution)\
\
7. **What is the big picture?**\
   - Desired user experience (UX)\
   - User journeys\
   - Product functionality\
   - Visual design\
   - Non-functional properties\
   - Technical implementation\
   - Scenarios, storyboards, workflows, design sketches, mock-ups, constraint stories are helpful\
\
8. **What alternatives are out there?**\
   - Describe the competitive landscape\
\
9. **How does this advance our strategy?**\
   - What OKR does this align to?\
   - How do we expect this opportunity to impact one or more of our key results?\
   - Provide projected values\
\
---\
\
## 6. PORTFOLIO PRIORITIZATION AND TEAM HEALTH BOARD\
\
### 6.1 Board Purpose\
\
Comprehensive portfolio visualization tool to generate discussion about:\
- Strategic priorities\
- Resourcing decisions  \
- Strategic alignment of work\
- Team health and capacity\
\
**Tool Origin**: Proprietary tool built by Chris Spagnuolo and colleagues at Riot Games.\
\
### 6.2 Board Structure\
\
**Initiative Cards (Left Side)**:\
- Stack-ranked by priority\
- Row 1 = highest priority (1 initiative max)\
- Row 2 = 2nd priority (2 initiatives max)\
- Row N = Nth priority (N initiatives max)\
- Within rows: rightmost card = highest priority in that row\
\
**Team Health Cards (Right Side)**:\
- Show which teams work on which initiatives\
- One card per team per initiative row\
- Team name white text = currently working\
- Team name faded = slated to work (not yet active)\
- Shows row and column number of initiative they're working against\
\
### 6.3 Initiative Color Coding\
\
- **Blue (Strategic)**: Explicitly solving customer problems, defined by product strategy\
- **Yellow (KTLO/Tech)**: Keep systems operational, support delivery teams\
- **Purple (Emergent)**: Significant business/customer needs, unplanned/unexpected\
\
### 6.4 Validation Status Dots\
\
- **Red dot**: Not validated\
- **Teal dot**: Currently in validation\
- **Green dot**: Fully validated\
\
**Rule**: First 3 rows should be fully validated and ready to work. Lower rows may not be validated or only partially validated.\
\
### 6.5 Team Health Indicators (Original 3-Dimension System)\
\
**Capacity**: Does team currently have bandwidth?\
- Green: Team has capacity for this initiative\
- Red: Team does not have capacity\
- Note: Can and should change as cards move down the stack\
- When capacity indicator turns red = message to org that team can accept NO additional WIP\
\
**Skillset**: Does team have technical skills required?\
- Green: Has all required skills\
- Red: Missing one or more skillsets\
- Note: May have skills for current work but not future work (hiring/training opportunity)\
\
**Leadership/Vision**: Does team have clear direction?\
- Green: Solid vision, well-written epics/stories, detailed acceptance criteria\
- Red: Lacking vision, incomplete/ambiguous stories\
- Note: Expected green for top 3 rows, may be red for discovery-phase work\
\
**Evolution Note**: Current app uses evolved 6-dimension system (Capacity, Skillset, Vision, Support, Teamwork, Autonomy) from Volume 1.\
\
### 6.6 Portfolio Prioritization Cadence\
\
**Every 2 weeks - 1 hour meeting**:\
- Attendees: All stakeholders (minimum: all VPs, Directors, Team Leads)\
- Wider audience = more valuable conversations\
\
**Pre-meeting**: \
- Teams update health cards\
- PMs update validation status\
\
**Agenda**:\
1. Remove completed initiatives, re-adjust positions\
2. Introduce and place new initiatives at appropriate priority\
3. Re-prioritize if necessary\
4. Discuss impact of new initiatives and re-prioritization\
5. Address items below Mendoza line (do we still care?)\
6. Address and resolve red items on active team health cards\
\

\
## 7. THREE HORIZONS OF STRATEGIC PLANNING\
\
### 7.1 McKinsey's Three Horizons Framework\
\
Ensures portfolio is balanced for value now, near future, and far future.\
\
**Horizon 1: Core Business**\
- Greatest profits and cash flow\
- Focus: Defend and extend the core\
- Innovate and create efficiencies within core\
- Reinvest to accelerate customer and revenue growth\
\
**Horizon 2: Emerging Opportunities**  \
- Considerable investment required\
- Push into new markets or use new technologies\
- Focus: Deliver market results, gain market share\
- Grow customer base and revenue\
- Scale business with trajectory to profitability\
\
**Horizon 3: New Capabilities and Business**\
- Create new capabilities for disruptive opportunities\
- Counter disruption threats\
- Focus: Deliver delightful "love metrics", measurable customer benefit\
- Gain active use and positive word-of-mouth\
- Develop compelling business model hypothesis\
- Validate customers willing to pay\
\
### 7.2 Investment Allocation\
\
**Historical Approach** (OUTDATED):\
- H1: 3-12 months delivery\
- H2: 24-36 months delivery\
- H3: 36-72 months delivery\
\
**Modern Approach**: NO TIME ASSIGNMENTS\
- Work continuously delivering value across all 3 horizons\
- Deliver as rapidly as possible\
- Horizons are about type of work, NOT delivery timeline\
\
**Resource Allocation Strategies**:\
- Traditional: 70-20-10 or 60-30-10 (H1-H2-H3)\
- Fast-moving markets: 50-30-20 or 40-30-30\
- True disruptors: H3=100% until viable business model established\
- Evaluate regularly based on market conditions\
- Portfolio board should clearly reflect chosen investment strategy\
\
### 7.3 Strategic Balance\
\
The investment split depends on:\
- Current product maturity\
- Market conditions\
- Competitive pressure\
- Innovation requirements\
\
**Key Rule**: Portfolio board visualization should clearly show the three horizons investment strategy in action.\
