\f0\fs24 \cf0 # VOLUME 6: WHAT-IF SCENARIO ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK\
\
## CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: PORTFOLIO GRID MECHANICS\
\
### Grid Structure\
**Pyramid Layout**: Row count increases with priority\
- Row 1: 1 slot (slot 1)\
- Row 2: 2 slots (slots 2-3)\
- Row 3: 3 slots (slots 4-6)\
- Row 4: 4 slots (slots 7-10)\
- Row 5: 5 slots (slots 11-15)\
- Row 6: 6 slots (slots 16-21)\
- Row 7: 7 slots (slots 22-28)\
- Row 8: 8 slots (slots 29-36)\
\
**Priority Flow**: RIGHT to LEFT, BOTTOM to TOP\
- Lower slot number = HIGHER priority\
- Slot 1 is the HIGHEST priority initiative\
- Within each row: rightmost position = highest priority in that row\
\
**Terminology Synonyms**:\
- "Row" = "Line" (users may say either)\
- "Slot" = "Position" = "Priority number"\
- "Moving up a row" = "Moving to a lower row number" = "Increasing priority"\
- "Moving down a row" = "Moving to a higher row number" = "Decreasing priority"\
\
### The Mendoza Line\
**Location**: Between Row 5 and Row 6 (between slots 15 and 16)\
\
**Above the Line** (Slots 1-15, Rows 1-5):\
- HIGH delivery confidence\
- Active, deliverable work\
- Full resource allocation\
- Teams focused on these initiatives\
- Expensive work HERE is GOOD (high ROI)\
- Discovery work HERE gets partial credit (validate before scaling)\
\
**Below the Line** (Slots 16+, Rows 6-8):\
- LOW delivery confidence\
- Backlog/future work\
- Limited or no resource allocation\
- Should NOT be actively worked\
- Expensive work HERE is WASTE (burning resources on non-deliverables)\
- Discovery work HERE is IDEAL (validate before committing expensive resources)\
\

\
## CASCADING LOGIC: HOW MOVES RIPPLE THROUGH THE PORTFOLIO\
\
### Core Mechanic\
When ANY initiative moves to a new slot, ALL initiatives in slots below the target position shift DOWN by 1 slot.\
\
**Example**: Moving initiative from slot 16 \uc0\u8594  slot 6\
- Initiative currently at slot 6 \uc0\u8594  moves to slot 7\
- Initiative currently at slot 7 \uc0\u8594  moves to slot 8\
- Initiative currently at slot 8 \uc0\u8594  moves to slot 9\
- ... continues ALL the way down ...\
- Initiative currently at slot 15 \uc0\u8594  moves to slot 16 (CROSSES MENDOZA LINE!)\
- Initiative originally at slot 16 (our moved item) \uc0\u8594  now at slot 6\
\
### Row Calculation from Slot\
```\
Row = ceil((-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 \'d7 slot)) / 2)\
```\
\
**Examples**:\
- Slot 1 \uc0\u8594  Row 1\
- Slot 6 \uc0\u8594  Row 3\
- Slot 15 \uc0\u8594  Row 5 (last slot above Mendoza Line)\
- Slot 16 \uc0\u8594  Row 6 (first slot below Mendoza Line)\
\

\
## IDENTIFYING "RELEVANT" INITIATIVES\
\
When reporting on a move's impact, ONLY report initiatives that meet these criteria:\
\
### 1. **Directly Displaced Initiative**\
The initiative currently sitting in the target slot\
- **Example**: Moving something to slot 6 affects the init currently at slot 6\
\
### 2. **Row Change Initiatives**\
Any initiative that moves to a DIFFERENT row number\
- **Example**: Slot 6 \uc0\u8594  Slot 7 (Row 3 \u8594  Row 4) = RELEVANT\
- **Example**: Slot 11 \uc0\u8594  Slot 12 (Row 5 \u8594  Row 5) = NOT relevant (same row)\
\
### 3. **Mendoza Line Crossings**\
Any initiative that crosses from above\uc0\u8594 below or below\u8594 above\
- **Example**: Slot 15 \uc0\u8594  Slot 16 (crosses from Row 5 to Row 6) = CRITICAL\
- **Example**: Slot 16 \uc0\u8594  Slot 15 (crosses from Row 6 to Row 5) = CRITICAL\
\
**Why this matters**: These three categories represent SIGNIFICANT priority shifts that impact:\
- Team focus and resource allocation\
- Delivery confidence expectations\
- Risk score calculations\
- Strategic vs operational balance\
\
---\
\
## REPORTING FORMAT FOR WHAT-IF SCENARIOS\
\
For EVERY relevant initiative affected by a move, report:\
1. **Initiative name**\
2. **OLD slot AND row** (e.g., "slot 15, Row 5")\
3. **NEW slot AND row** (e.g., "slot 16, Row 6")\
4. **Mendoza crossing status** (if applicable)\
5. **Teams assigned** (who is impacted)\
\
**CORRECT Example**:\
"API Gateway v3 moves from slot 6 (Row 3) \uc0\u8594  slot 7 (Row 4)"\
\
**INCORRECT Example** (missing row info):\
"API Gateway v3 moves from slot 6 to slot 7"\
\
---\
\
## RESPONSE QUALITY CHECKLIST FOR WHAT-IF SCENARIOS\
\
Every what-if analysis MUST include:\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Current State**:\
- Initiative's current slot and row\
- Current teams assigned\
- Current risk score\
- Current efficiency/confidence scores\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Proposed Change**:\
- Target slot and row\
- Direction of movement (up/down, above/below line)\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Relevant Initiatives Affected**:\
- ONLY report: directly displaced, row changes, Mendoza crossings\
- For each: old slot/row \uc0\u8594  new slot/row\
- Note Mendoza crossings prominently\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Team Impacts**:\
- Teams gaining/losing work\
- Utilization changes\
- Capacity freed/consumed\
- Over-utilization risks\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Recalculated Metrics**:\
- New risk scores (show calculation)\
- New efficiency score\
- New delivery confidence\
- Explain why scores changed\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Strategic Implications**:\
- OKR alignment impact\
- Strategic vs KTLO balance\
- Validation status concerns\
- Resource optimization opportunities\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Actionable Recommendations**:\
- Should we make this move?\
- What else should we consider?\
- What mitigations are needed?\
- Alternative options to explore}
