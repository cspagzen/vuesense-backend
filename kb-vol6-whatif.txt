\f0\fs24 \cf0 # VOLUME 6: WHAT-IF SCENARIO ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK\
\
## CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: PORTFOLIO GRID MECHANICS\
\
### Grid Structure\
**Pyramid Layout**: Row count increases with priority\
- Row 1: 1 slot (slot 1)\
- Row 2: 2 slots (slots 2-3)\
- Row 3: 3 slots (slots 4-6)\
- Row 4: 4 slots (slots 7-10)\
- Row 5: 5 slots (slots 11-15)\
- Row 6: 6 slots (slots 16-21)\
- Row 7: 7 slots (slots 22-28)\
- Row 8: 8 slots (slots 29-36)\
\
**Priority Flow**: RIGHT to LEFT, BOTTOM to TOP\
- Lower slot number = HIGHER priority\
- Slot 1 is the HIGHEST priority initiative\
- Within each row: rightmost position = highest priority in that row\
\
**Terminology Synonyms**:\
- "Row" = "Line" (users may say either)\
- "Slot" = "Position" = "Priority number"\
- "Moving up a row" = "Moving to a lower row number" = "Increasing priority"\
- "Moving down a row" = "Moving to a higher row number" = "Decreasing priority"\
\
### The Mendoza Line\
**Location**: Between Row 5 and Row 6 (between slots 15 and 16)\
\
**Above the Line** (Slots 1-15, Rows 1-5):\
- HIGH delivery confidence\
- Active, deliverable work\
- Full resource allocation\
- Teams focused on these initiatives\
- Expensive work HERE is GOOD (high ROI)\
- Discovery work HERE gets partial credit (validate before scaling)\
\
**Below the Line** (Slots 16+, Rows 6-8):\
- LOW delivery confidence\
- Backlog/future work\
- Limited or no resource allocation\
- Should NOT be actively worked\
- Expensive work HERE is WASTE (burning resources on non-deliverables)\
- Discovery work HERE is IDEAL (validate before committing expensive resources)\
\
---\
\
## CASCADING LOGIC: HOW MOVES RIPPLE THROUGH THE PORTFOLIO\
\
### Core Mechanic\
When ANY initiative moves to a new slot, ALL initiatives in slots below the target position shift DOWN by 1 slot.\
\
**Example**: Moving initiative from slot 16 \uc0\u8594  slot 6\
- Initiative currently at slot 6 \uc0\u8594  moves to slot 7\
- Initiative currently at slot 7 \uc0\u8594  moves to slot 8\
- Initiative currently at slot 8 \uc0\u8594  moves to slot 9\
- ... continues ALL the way down ...\
- Initiative currently at slot 15 \uc0\u8594  moves to slot 16 (CROSSES MENDOZA LINE!)\
- Initiative originally at slot 16 (our moved item) \uc0\u8594  now at slot 6\
\
### Row Calculation from Slot\
```\
Row = ceil((-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 \'d7 slot)) / 2)\
```\
\
**Examples**:\
- Slot 1 \uc0\u8594  Row 1\
- Slot 6 \uc0\u8594  Row 3\
- Slot 15 \uc0\u8594  Row 5 (last slot above Mendoza Line)\
- Slot 16 \uc0\u8594  Row 6 (first slot below Mendoza Line)\
\
---\
\
## IDENTIFYING "RELEVANT" INITIATIVES\
\
When reporting on a move's impact, ONLY report initiatives that meet these criteria:\
\
### 1. **Directly Displaced Initiative**\
The initiative currently sitting in the target slot\
- **Example**: Moving something to slot 6 affects the init currently at slot 6\
\
### 2. **Row Change Initiatives**\
Any initiative that moves to a DIFFERENT row number\
- **Example**: Slot 6 \uc0\u8594  Slot 7 (Row 3 \u8594  Row 4) = RELEVANT\
- **Example**: Slot 11 \uc0\u8594  Slot 12 (Row 5 \u8594  Row 5) = NOT relevant (same row)\
\
### 3. **Mendoza Line Crossings**\
Any initiative that crosses from above\uc0\u8594 below or below\u8594 above\
- **Example**: Slot 15 \uc0\u8594  Slot 16 (crosses from Row 5 to Row 6) = CRITICAL\
- **Example**: Slot 16 \uc0\u8594  Slot 15 (crosses from Row 6 to Row 5) = CRITICAL\
\
**Why this matters**: These three categories represent SIGNIFICANT priority shifts that impact:\
- Team focus and resource allocation\
- Delivery confidence expectations\
- Risk score calculations\
- Strategic vs operational balance\
\
---\
\
## REPORTING FORMAT FOR WHAT-IF SCENARIOS\
\
For EVERY relevant initiative affected by a move, report:\
1. **Initiative name**\
2. **OLD slot AND row** (e.g., "slot 15, Row 5")\
3. **NEW slot AND row** (e.g., "slot 16, Row 6")\
4. **Mendoza crossing status** (if applicable)\
5. **Teams assigned** (who is impacted)\
\
**CORRECT Example**:\
"API Gateway v3 moves from slot 6 (Row 3) \uc0\u8594  slot 7 (Row 4)"\
\
**INCORRECT Example** (missing row info):\
"API Gateway v3 moves from slot 6 to slot 7"\
\
---\
\
## RESPONSE QUALITY CHECKLIST FOR WHAT-IF SCENARIOS\
\
Every what-if analysis MUST include:\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Current State**:\
- Initiative's current slot and row\
- Current teams assigned\
- Current risk score\
- Current efficiency/confidence scores\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Proposed Change**:\
- Target slot and row\
- Direction of movement (up/down, above/below line)\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Relevant Initiatives Affected**:\
- ONLY report: directly displaced, row changes, Mendoza crossings\
- For each: old slot/row \uc0\u8594  new slot/row\
- Note Mendoza crossings prominently\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Team Impacts**:\
- Teams gaining/losing work\
- Utilization changes\
- Capacity freed/consumed\
- Over-utilization risks\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Recalculated Metrics**:\
- New risk scores (show calculation)\
- New efficiency score\
- New delivery confidence\
- Explain why scores changed\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Strategic Implications**:\
- OKR alignment impact\
- Strategic vs KTLO balance\
- Validation status concerns\
- Resource optimization opportunities\
\
\uc0\u9989  **Actionable Recommendations**:\
- Should we make this move?\
- What else should we consider?\
- What mitigations are needed?\
- Alternative options to explore}

# VOLUME 6 UPDATE: REMOVAL LOGIC & CASCADING

## CRITICAL FIX: REMOVAL CASCADING LOGIC

### How Removal Works (OPPOSITE of Adding)

When an initiative is **REMOVED** from the board:
- All initiatives BELOW it shift **UP** by 1 slot to fill the gap
- This is the OPPOSITE of adding (which shifts everything DOWN)

**Example: Removing initiative at slot 10**
```
BEFORE REMOVAL:
Slot 10: Initiative X (being removed)
Slot 11: Initiative A
Slot 12: Initiative B
Slot 13: Initiative C
...
Slot 15: Initiative Z
Slot 16: Initiative Q (below Mendoza Line)

AFTER REMOVAL:
Slot 10: Initiative A (moved UP from 11)
Slot 11: Initiative B (moved UP from 12)
Slot 12: Initiative C (moved UP from 13)
...
Slot 14: Initiative Z (moved UP from 15)
Slot 15: Initiative Q (moved UP from 16) ← CROSSES ABOVE MENDOZA LINE!
```

### Key Implications of Removal

1. **Gap Filling**: The removed slot is immediately filled by the next initiative
2. **Upward Cascade**: Everything below moves UP, not down
3. **Mendoza Crossings**: Initiative at slot 16 moves to slot 15 (crosses ABOVE line)
4. **Priority Improvement**: All initiatives below get better priority (lower slot numbers)

The AI must recognize ALL these terms as "remove from board":

### Primary Removal Terms
- remove
- delete
- cancel
- kill
- eliminate
- discontinue
- abandon

### Deprioritization Terms  
- shelve
- pause
- defer
- deprioritize
- move to pipeline
- move to backlog
- move to bullpen
- take off board
- take off the board
- pull from board

### Stop/End Terms
- stop

- halt
- cease
- suspend
- put on hold
- freeze

### Informal Terms
- drop
- cut
- ditch
- scrap
- nix
- axe
- can (as in "can the project")

### Question Forms
- "what if we don't do [initiative]"
- "what if [initiative] goes away"
- "should we stop [initiative]"
- "can we drop [initiative]"

---

## BOARD → PIPELINE MOVES

### Key Distinction
- **Remove completely** = Initiative disappears, no longer tracked
- **Move to pipeline** = Initiative moves to inactive backlog, may return later

### When User Says "Shelve" or "Deprioritize"
Default to **move to pipeline** (not complete removal), unless user specifies:
- "remove completely"
- "cancel permanently"  
- "we're not doing this anymore"

### Response for Pipeline Moves
```
"Moving Integration Hub to the pipeline frees up Integration Services and API Platform teams - about 40% combined capacity. This deprioritizes the work but keeps it available for future activation. Everything below Integration Hub shifts up by 1 slot, so the initiative at slot 16 moves to slot 15 and crosses above the Mendoza Line. Want to know which initiative that is and what it means?"
```

---

## REMOVAL SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Simple Removal (No Mendoza Crossing)

**User**: "What if we cancel API Gateway v3?"

**Current State**: API Gateway v3 at slot 6 (Row 3)

**Analysis**:
```
"Canceling API Gateway v3 frees up Backend Platform and Security Engineering teams - about 35% combined capacity. Everything from slot 7 down shifts up by 1, so the initiative at slot 7 becomes slot 6, slot 8 becomes slot 7, etc. No Mendoza Line crossings happen since API Gateway was above the line. Those teams could be reallocated to Data Lake v2 or other high-priority work. Want suggestions on where to use that freed capacity?"
```

### Scenario 2: Removal Causes Mendoza Crossing

**User**: "What if we shelve Integration Hub?"

**Current State**: Integration Hub at slot 15 (Row 5)

**Analysis**:
```
"Shelving Integration Hub frees Integration Services and API Platform - about 40% capacity. Everything below it shifts up, so whatever's at slot 16 moves to slot 15 and crosses above the Mendoza Line. Let me check which initiative that is... 

[After checking data]

That would be Data Lake v2 moving from slot 16 to slot 15 - it crosses above the line and becomes active deliverable work. But Data Lake v2 is not-validated, which is risky for above-line work. You'd want to validate it first or use that freed capacity differently. Want to explore alternatives?"
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Removals

**User**: "What if we cancel both Integration Hub and API Gateway v3?"

**Analysis**:
```
"Canceling both frees up 4 teams total with about 70% combined capacity - that's significant. Here's what happens to the board:

First removal (API Gateway at slot 6): Everything from slot 7+ shifts up by 1
Second removal (Integration Hub, now at slot 14 after first shift): Everything from slot 15+ shifts up by 1

Net result: Two initiatives that were below the Mendoza Line move above it. The board compresses and you have major capacity to reallocate. This is basically a portfolio reset. Want me to identify which below-line initiatives would become active?"
```

---

## CAPACITY FREED CALCULATIONS

When initiative removed, freed capacity = sum of team capacities assigned to it

**Example**:
```
Integration Hub teams:
- Integration Services: 50 points capacity, 82% utilized = 41 points in use
- API Platform: 45 points capacity, 76% utilized = 34 points in use

Freed capacity: 75 points total (41 + 34)
Available for reallocation: 75 points
```

---

## REALLOCATION OPPORTUNITIES

After removal, AI should suggest:

1. **High-risk initiatives that need help**
   - Calculate which initiatives have highest risk scores
   - Identify if freed teams could reduce risk
   - Show projected risk score improvement

2. **Below-line initiatives ready to activate**
   - Check validation status
   - Verify freed capacity sufficient
   - Recommend best candidates

3. **Overloaded teams that need relief**
   - Identify teams >90% utilization
   - Calculate if freed capacity could help
   - Suggest specific reassignments

**Example Response**:
```
"With 75 points freed from removing Integration Hub, here are three ways to use it:

1. Reduce risk on Data Lake v2: Add API Platform team, drops risk score from 117 to 85
2. Activate Mobile App from pipeline: Needs 80 points, you have 75 - close, might work with scope reduction
3. Help overloaded Backend Platform: They're at 103% utilization, adding Integration Services gets them to healthy 88%

Which direction interests you?"
```

---

## REMOVAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before analyzing removal:
1. ✅ Verify initiative exists in active board
2. ✅ Confirm current slot and row
3. ✅ Identify all teams assigned
4. ✅ Calculate total freed capacity
5. ✅ Check if slot 16 exists (Mendoza crossing potential)
6. ✅ Identify reallocation opportunities

After removal analysis:
1. ✅ Show upward cascade (not downward)
2. ✅ Highlight Mendoza crossings if any
3. ✅ Calculate freed capacity
4. ✅ List affected teams
5. ✅ Suggest reallocation options
6. ✅ Note strategic implications

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Removal shifts initiatives UP, not down** (opposite of adding)
2. **Gap-filling is automatic** - no empty slots remain
3. **Mendoza crossings from below→above are POSITIVE** (work becomes deliverable)
4. **Always calculate freed capacity** from removed initiative
5. **Suggest reallocation options** - don't just analyze, guide next steps
6. **Verify initiative exists** before analyzing removal
7. **Recognize ALL removal synonyms** from the complete list above
