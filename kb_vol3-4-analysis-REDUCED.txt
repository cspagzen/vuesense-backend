# VOLUME 3+4: ANALYSIS METHODS & CRITICAL RULES (REDUCED)

## 1. PORTFOLIO PATTERN ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Common Portfolio Patterns

**Capacity Overload Patterns**:
- Multiple teams >90% utilization
- Teams appearing on 4+ initiatives simultaneously
- Capacity at-risk/critical across related teams
- Pattern indicates: over-commitment, need to reduce WIP or grow teams

**Validation Debt Patterns**:
- Strategic work above Mendoza line with red dots (not-validated)
- Pattern indicates: waste risk - expensive resources on unproven assumptions
- Correlation with high risk scores
- Teams building before validating = expensive pivots likely

**Stagnation Patterns**:
- Multiple initiatives <25% progress for extended periods
- Combined with high flagged story counts
- Teams missing velocity targets
- OKR trends showing downward slopes
- Pattern indicates: capacity issues, estimation problems, or external blockers

**Dependency Patterns**:
- Same team appearing as blocker for multiple initiatives
- Bottleneck teams with autonomy at-risk across portfolio
- Look in comments for repeated team names in "waiting on" statements

**Risk Accumulation Patterns**:
- Multiple high-risk initiatives concentrated on few teams
- Risk scores >12 clustering in specific priority rows
- Indicates: need to redistribute work or add resources

**Validation Patterns**:
- Above-line work predominantly not-validated (red dots)
- Below-line work predominantly validated (green dots) - INVERTED from ideal
- Ideal state: top 3 rows fully validated, discovery work below line

**Work Type Distribution Patterns**:
- Portfolio heavy on expensive work (development) vs. discovery
- Or vice versa: too much discovery, not enough delivery

**Comment/Blocker Patterns**:
- Repeated keywords across team comments ("API delays", "waiting for design")
- Common blockers indicate systemic organizational issues
- Extract keywords, count frequency, identify top 3-5 recurring themes

## 2. BULLPEN & PIPELINE MANAGEMENT

### 2.1 Bullpen Definition

**Bullpen** = Initiative pipeline (future work not yet on the prioritized board)

- Priority = "bullpen" (not numbered 1-15 or 16+)
- May or may not be validated
- Represents potential future work
- Teams identified but not yet assigned/active

### 2.2 Answering Pipeline Questions

**"What's in our pipeline?"**
1. Access `window.boardData.bullpen`
2. Count total items
3. Group by type (strategic/KTLO/emergent)
4. Group by validation status (validated/in-validation/not-validated)
5. Return: "Pipeline has [N] initiatives: [X] strategic, [Y] KTLO, [Z] emergent. [N] validated, [M] in validation"

**"What teams would we need to activate pipeline items?"**
1. Get all bullpen initiatives
2. Extract unique team names from teams arrays
3. Cross-reference with current team capacity and health
4. Return: "Pipeline requires [Team A, Team B, Team C]. Current status: Team A at 95% utilization (overloaded), Team B has skillset at-risk, Team C healthy with capacity"

**"Should we activate initiative X from the pipeline?"**
1. Check initiative validation status (validated = lower risk)
2. Check required teams' current health and capacity
3. Check if teams are on other above-line work
4. Calculate impact on delivery confidence if activated
5. Recommend: "Yes if teams healthy and validated" OR "No, validate first and address Team Y capacity issues"

### 2.3 Pipeline Strategy

- Validated pipeline items ready for activation when capacity opens
- Not-validated pipeline items need validation BEFORE activation
- Monitor team requirements to plan hiring/training ahead

## 3. OKR TREND ANALYSIS & FORECASTING

### 3.1 OKR Data Structure

`window.boardData.okrs` contains:
- objective (string)
- keyResults (array)

Each keyResult has:
- name (string)
- target (number)
- current (number)
- unit (string: percent, count, score, days, users, etc.)
- history (array of {date, value} objects)

### 3.2 Calculating 90-Day Trend

**Process**:
1. Get `keyResult.history` array
2. Filter to last 90 days from current date
3. If <3 data points, cannot calculate reliable trend
4. Calculate linear regression slope (rate of change per day)
5. Convert to weekly rate: slope × 7
6. Project 30 days forward: current + (slope × 30)

**Linear Regression Formula**:
- For points (x₁,y₁), (x₂,y₂), ..., (xₙ,yₙ)
- Slope = Σ[(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ)] / Σ[(xᵢ - x̄)²]
- Where x̄ and ȳ are means

### 3.3 Required Pace Calculation

**Formula**:
Required Weekly Pace = (Target - Current) / (Days Remaining / 7)

**Example**:
- Target: 40% increase
- Current: 28%
- Gap: 12%
- Days Remaining: 45 days
- Required Weekly Pace: 12% / (45/7) = 12% / 6.4 weeks = 1.9% per week

### 3.4 Response Format for Trends

"Based on 90-day trend analysis:

**Key Result: [Name]**
- Current: [X][unit] ([gap] from target)
- 90-day trend: [+/-Y][unit] per week
- 30-day projection: [Z][unit] ([change] increase/decrease)
- Required pace: [+/-W][unit] per week
- Current pace: [+/-Y][unit] per week
- Status: [ON TRACK / BEHIND / AHEAD]

**Recommendation**: [If behind, specific actions to accelerate]"

### 3.5 Interpreting Status

- **ON TRACK**: Current pace ≥ required pace (within 10% tolerance)
- **BEHIND**: Current pace < required pace
- **AHEAD**: Current pace > required pace + 20%

**Actions when BEHIND**:
- Identify blockers in related initiatives
- Check team health for initiatives tied to this KR
- Recommend: accelerate specific initiatives, remove blockers, add resources

## 4. WHAT-IF SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Types of What-If Scenarios

**Type 1: Board → Board (Priority Change)**
- Moving an initiative to different slot on active board
- Example: "What if Data Lake moves to row 3?"
- Changes: Priority shifts, Mendoza line crossings possible

**Type 2: Pipeline → Board (Activation)**
- Moving inactive initiative to active board
- Example: "What if we activate Mobile App?"
- Impact: Capacity allocation, team assignments, risk calculations

**Type 3: Board → Pipeline (Deprioritization/Shelving)**
- Moving active initiative to inactive pipeline
- Example: "What if we shelve Integration Hub?"
- Impact: Capacity freed, everything below shifts up, Mendoza crossings

**Type 4: Team Reassignment**
- Moving team from one initiative to another
- Example: "What if Backend moves from X to Y?"
- Impact: Both initiatives affected, capacity reallocated

**Type 5: Removal/Completion**
- Removing initiative entirely or marking complete
- Example: "What if Data Lake completes?"
- Impact: Capacity freed, initiatives shift up

### 4.2 Core Impact Categories

For ANY what-if scenario, calculate these impacts:

**1. Capacity Impact**
- Which teams affected?
- Utilization before/after
- Overload risks (>95%)
- Freed capacity amounts

**2. Risk Impact**
- Initiative risk scores before/after
- Overall portfolio risk change
- New risks introduced
- Risks resolved

**3. Delivery Confidence Impact**
- Confidence score before/after
- Penalties added/removed
- Focus bonus impact

**4. Mendoza Line Crossings**
- Which initiatives cross above/below line?
- Validation status of crossing initiatives
- Waste implications

**5. Priority Cascades**
- Which initiatives change priority?
- How does ranking shift?
- Strategic impact of reordering

### 4.3 What-If Response Structure

1. **Acknowledge scenario**
2. **Calculate impacts** (capacity, risk, confidence)
3. **Identify risks/concerns**
4. **Provide recommendation**
5. **Offer alternative** (if concerns exist)

**Example Response Format**:
"Moving Data Lake to row 3 would:
- Push Integration Hub to row 16 (below line) - expensive development work becomes waste
- Backend Platform goes from 88% to 103% utilization - burnout risk
- Portfolio confidence drops from 82% to 76% (capacity penalties)

**Recommendation**: Move to row 4 instead, or add API Platform team to Data Lake to spread load. Want to see that alternative?"

## 5. ENTITY VALIDATION (CRITICAL)

### 5.1 Validation Rules

**BEFORE analyzing ANY query:**
1. Extract ALL entity names (initiatives, teams) mentioned by user
2. Validate EACH entity exists in actual data
3. If entity not found → STOP and suggest alternatives
4. NEVER proceed with fictional data

### 5.2 Where to Check

1. `boardData.initiatives` (active initiatives with priority 1-36)
2. `boardData.bullpen` or `boardData.pipeline` (inactive initiatives)
3. `boardData.teams` (all teams)

### 5.3 Response Based on Match

**If EXACT match found**:
- Proceed with analysis

**If NO match found**:
- STOP immediately
- Do NOT create fictional analysis
- Respond: "I don't see '[Entity Name]' in the current portfolio. Did you mean [closest match]?"
- List 3-5 actual options from the data

**If CLOSE match found (fuzzy matching)**:
- Ask for confirmation: "Did you mean '[Actual Name]' instead of '[User's Input]'?"

### 5.4 Validation Examples

**Example 1: Non-existent Team**
```
User: "What if Backend Platform moves to Data Lake?"
AI: "I don't see 'Backend Platform' as a team in the portfolio. Did you mean 'Platform Core'? 

Here are the actual teams I can see:
- Platform Core
- Data Infrastructure  
- Frontend Services

Which one did you mean?"
```

**Example 2: Non-existent Initiative**
```
User: "What if Honky Dory completes by end of month?"
AI: "I don't see 'Honky Dory' in the current portfolio. Here are the active initiatives:
- Data Lake v2
- Integration Hub
- API Gateway v3

Which one did you mean?"
```

---

## 6. CRITICAL RESPONSE RULES

### 6.1 NEVER Do These

❌ Analyze non-existent initiatives
❌ Make up team assignments
❌ Assume "it's probably in the pipeline"
❌ Generate fictional data
❌ Say "assuming this exists..."
❌ Proceed without validating entity names
❌ Create long responses for made-up data

### 6.2 ALWAYS Do These

✅ Validate every entity mentioned
✅ Check both board and pipeline
✅ Suggest actual alternatives when no match
✅ Ask for clarification when ambiguous
✅ Use fuzzy matching for typos
✅ Be explicit about location (board vs pipeline)
✅ Stop immediately if entity doesn't exist
✅ List real options from actual data

### 6.3 Response Style

**Core Principles:**
1. Start with the answer, not the structure
2. Use plain English, not bullet points (unless specifically needed)
3. 3-5 sentences for simple queries
4. Offer details at the end, don't force them upfront
5. Be human, not robotic

**Response Length by Query Type**:

- **Simple "What if"**: 4-5 sentences with clear recommendation
- **Complex scenarios**: 6-8 sentences with trade-offs explained
- **Capacity/Risk calculations**: Lead with conclusion, offer details
