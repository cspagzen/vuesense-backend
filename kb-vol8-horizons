# VOLUME 8: THREE HORIZONS STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

## CRITICAL DISCLAIMER

**This is an INFERENCE model, not explicit data.** The portfolio does not have a "horizon" field. We infer horizons from:
- Initiative type (Strategic/KTLO/Emergent)
- Validation status (not-validated/in-validation/validated)
- Activity type (Research, Development, Operations, etc.)

ALWAYS state this when discussing horizons: "Based on the initiative characteristics (this is an inference)..."

---

## HORIZON INFERENCE LOGIC

### Primary Classification Rules

**Horizon 1 (H1) - Defend Core:**
```
IF initiative.type === 'KTLO' 
OR initiative.activity IN ['Defects/Fixes', 'Operational Support', 'Compliance', 'Documentation']
THEN H1

Rationale: KTLO work sustains current operations
```

**Horizon 3 (H3) - Create Future:**
```
IF initiative.validation === 'not-validated'
AND initiative.activity IN ['Research', 'Experimentation', 'Validation', 'Prototyping']
THEN H3

Rationale: Unvalidated exploratory work = future options
```

**Horizon 2 (H2) - Build Growth:**
```
IF initiative.type === 'Strategic'
AND initiative.validation IN ['validated', 'in-validation']
AND initiative.activity IN ['Development', 'Integration', 'Go-to-Market', 'Infrastructure']
THEN H2

Rationale: Validated strategic work ready to scale
```

### Edge Cases & Nuance

**Emergent Type Analysis**:
- Emergent + not-validated → H3 (new opportunity, unproven)
- Emergent + validated → H2 (reactive but proven, scale it)
- Emergent + KTLO activity → H1 (operational fire drill)

**Strategic Work Ambiguity**:
- Strategic + not-validated + Development → Likely H3 (building unvalidated = risky)
- Strategic + validated + Research → Likely H2 (researching how to scale validated concept)

**When Unclear**:
- Default to H2 for Strategic initiatives
- Default to H1 for KTLO initiatives
- Always note the ambiguity to user

## IDEAL HORIZON PLACEMENT ON THE BOARD

### Mendoza Line Implications by Horizon

**Horizon 1 (Defend Core):**
- **SHOULD BE**: Above Mendoza Line (slots 1-15)
- **Rationale**: Operational work must be resourced to maintain business
- **Risk if below line**: Business operations degrade, customer impact, revenue loss

**Horizon 2 (Build Growth):**
- **SHOULD BE**: Above Mendoza Line (slots 1-15)
- **Rationale**: Validated opportunities ready to scale need resources
- **Risk if below line**: Growth stalls, competitive disadvantage, missed market window

**Horizon 3 (Create Future):**
- **SHOULD BE**: Below Mendoza Line (slots 16+)
- **Rationale**: Unvalidated work should use cheap discovery resources before expensive delivery resources
- **Risk if above line**: Burning expensive capacity on unproven ideas, high waste potential

### Red Flags in Horizon Placement

**H1 below Mendoza Line:**
- Critical operations starved of resources
- "Keeping lights on" work being neglected
- Short-term revenue at risk

**H2 below Mendoza Line:**
- Validated growth opportunities not being pursued
- Competitive positioning weakening
- Growth targets in jeopardy

**H3 above Mendoza Line:**
- Expensive resources on unvalidated ideas
- High risk of waste
- Should validate first (move below line), then promote when validated

---

## PORTFOLIO BALANCE ANALYSIS

### Recommended Balance Ranges

**Conservative Portfolio (Mature Market)**:
- H1: 70-80% (defend strong position)
- H2: 15-20% (selective growth)
- H3: 5-10% (minimal exploration)

**Balanced Portfolio (Standard)**:
- H1: 60-70% (maintain core)
- H2: 20-30% (active growth)
- H3: 10-15% (future options)

**Aggressive Portfolio (High Growth Market)**:
- H1: 50-60% (baseline operations)
- H2: 25-35% (aggressive growth)
- H3: 15-20% (heavy innovation)

### Imbalance Indicators & Implications

**Too Much H1 (>80%)**:
- **Symptom**: Innovation starvation
- **Risk**: Disruption vulnerability, no growth pipeline
- **Action**: Shift resources to H2/H3, validate new opportunities

**Too Little H1 (<50%)**:
- **Symptom**: Operational neglect
- **Risk**: Current business degrading, customer churn
- **Action**: Stabilize core before expanding

**Too Much H3 (>25%)**:
- **Symptom**: Scattered focus, "shiny object syndrome"
- **Risk**: Nothing reaching scale, execution deficit
- **Action**: Validate faster, promote winners to H2, kill losers

**Too Little H3 (<5%)**:
- **Symptom**: No future pipeline
- **Risk**: Growth cliff in 2-3 years
- **Action**: Invest in discovery, allocate exploration budget

**Weak H2 (<15%)**:
- **Symptom**: Missing middle, no growth engine
- **Risk**: Revenue plateau, H3 ideas with nowhere to go
- **Action**: Validate H3 faster, resource validated concepts

## HORIZON TRANSITION PATTERNS

### H3 → H2 Transition (Validation Graduate)
**When to promote**:
- Validation complete, assumptions proven
- Customer demand validated
- Technical feasibility confirmed
- Business model viable

**How to execute**:
- Move from below Mendoza Line to above (slot 16 → slot 15 or higher)
- Increase resource allocation
- Shift from discovery teams to delivery teams
- Change activity from Validation → Development

**Example Query**:
"Which H3 initiatives are ready to graduate to H2?"

### H2 → H1 Transition (Growth Becomes Core)
**When to promote**:
- Scaled to significant revenue
- Operational maturity achieved
- Now part of core business
- Sustaining mode appropriate

**How to execute**:
- Change type from Strategic → KTLO
- Shift from innovation teams to operations teams
- Focus on efficiency and optimization
- Reduce innovation investment

**Example Query**:
"Are any H2 initiatives mature enough to become H1?"

### H3 → Archive (Failed Experiment)
**When to kill**:
- Validation failed, assumptions disproven
- Market not viable
- Technical infeasibility
- Better alternatives emerged

**How to execute**:
- Move to archive/pipeline
- Free up resources
- Document learnings
- Reallocate capacity to other H3 work

## RESPONSE TEMPLATES BY SCENARIO

### Healthy Portfolio
```
"Your Three Horizons balance looks healthy:

H1: 65% - Solid core business focus, all above Mendoza Line ✓
H2: 25% - Good growth engine, 4 validated initiatives scaling ✓  
H3: 10% - Appropriate future investment, mostly below line for cheap validation ✓

This is a balanced portfolio. You're defending the core (H1), building growth (H2), and creating future options (H3). The Mendoza Line placement is correct - expensive H1/H2 work above the line, cheap H3 exploration below.

One opportunity: Your H3 initiatives could validate faster. Want ideas on accelerating validation?"
```

### Innovation Starved Portfolio
```
"Your portfolio is heavily skewed toward H1:

H1: 85% - Over-indexed on core business
H2: 12% - Weak growth engine ⚠️
H3: 3% - Critically low future investment 🚨

This is innovation starvation. You're optimizing today at the expense of tomorrow. In 2-3 years, you'll hit a growth cliff when current initiatives mature.

Immediate actions:
1. Identify H1 work that could shift to H2/H3 (lowest priority KTLO)
2. Move 15-20% capacity from H1 to H3 validation work
3. Validate aggressively, promote H3 winners to H2
4. Target: 65/25/10 balance within 2 quarters

This feels risky, but NOT doing it is riskier. Want me to model the capacity shift?"
```

### Scattered Portfolio
```
"You have execution problems:

H1: 55% - Under-invested, some below Mendoza Line ⚠️
H2: 20% - Healthy percentage but weak initiatives
H3: 25% - Too many small bets, nothing graduating 🚨

You're exploring too much and executing too little. 12 H3 initiatives with thin resources means slow validation and nothing graduating to H2.

Immediate actions:
1. Kill the bottom 6 H3 initiatives (free up 40% capacity)
2. Consolidate into 4-6 well-funded H3 experiments
3. Validate faster with focused resources
4. Fix H1 gaps (move critical KTLO above Mendoza Line)
5. Graduate H3 winners to H2 aggressively

Target: 65/25/10 with FEWER, BETTER-FUNDED initiatives. Quality over quantity. Want help prioritizing which H3 to kill?"
```

## MULTI-DIMENSIONAL PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS

### Core Principle: Layer Multiple Perspectives

When users ask broad questions like "Is our portfolio healthy?", provide **comprehensive analysis** by combining:

1. **Direct data analysis** (team health, risk scores, capacity)
2. **Strategic framing** (Three Horizons when relevant)
3. **Progressive disclosure** (basic → detailed → strategic frameworks)

**DON'T force everything through horizons lens**
**DO use horizons as ONE lens among many**

---

## RESPONSE LAYERING STRATEGY

### Layer 1: Direct Answer with Actual Data (ALWAYS FIRST)

Start with concrete portfolio metrics:
- Team health status (dimensions at-risk)
- Initiative risk scores (specific numbers)
- Capacity utilization (actual percentages)
- Validation status (how many not-validated)
- Mendoza Line placement (above/below line issues)

**Example Opening:**
```
Looking at your portfolio health:

**Team Health**: 3 teams are at-risk - Platform Core (capacity critical), Data Infrastructure (skillset issues), Frontend Services (support gaps). This affects 8 initiatives directly.

**Risk Profile**: You have 4 high-risk initiatives (scores >100): Data Lake v2 (117), Integration Hub (105), API Gateway v3 (98). Main drivers are capacity constraints and validation gaps.

**Capacity**: Overall utilization at 84%, but 5 teams are >90%. Backend Platform at 103% is critical.

**Validation Debt**: 6 initiatives above the Mendoza Line are not-validated - that's risky expensive work on unproven assumptions.
```

### Layer 2: Synthesis & Patterns (CONNECT THE DOTS)

After presenting data, synthesize what it means:

```
What this tells us: Your biggest issue isn't any single initiative - it's systemic capacity strain. Teams are overloaded, which creates risk across the board. The not-validated work above the line compounds this - you're burning scarce capacity on unproven ideas.
```

### Layer 3: Strategic Context (INTRODUCE FRAMEWORKS)

NOW offer deeper analysis using frameworks:

```
Want a more strategic view? I can analyze this through a portfolio investment lens - looking at whether you're balancing today's execution with tomorrow's opportunities. It might reveal some structural issues worth addressing.
```

### Layer 4: Framework Deep-Dive (ONLY IF REQUESTED)

If user says yes, THEN apply Three Horizons:

```
Looking at your portfolio through an investment lens (this uses something called Three Horizons):

**Today's Business (keeping operations running)**: 78% - this is high, explains the capacity strain
**Growth Engine (scaling proven opportunities)**: 15% - weak, only 3 validated initiatives  
**Future Options (exploring what's next)**: 7% - thin pipeline, risky for long-term

The pattern: You're over-investing in operations at the expense of growth and innovation. This creates the capacity crunch AND starves your future.

## QUERY-SPECIFIC MULTI-DIMENSIONAL RESPONSES

### "Is Our Portfolio Healthy?"

**Layer 1: Data-Driven Health Check**
```
Your portfolio shows mixed health:

✓ **Strengths**:
- Strong operational foundation (12 KTLO initiatives, all validated)
- Good Mendoza Line discipline (87% of above-line work is validated)
- Balanced team distribution (no single team on >4 initiatives)

⚠️ **Concerns**:
- Team health: 4 teams at-risk (Platform Core capacity critical, Data Infrastructure skillset gaps)
- Risk concentration: 3 initiatives >100 risk score, all dependent on same 2 teams
- Capacity: 84% overall utilization, but 6 teams >90% (overload risk)

🚨 **Critical Issues**:
- Integration Hub (slot 15): risk score 105, not-validated, on already-strained teams
- Backend Platform: 103% utilization, on 5 initiatives simultaneously
```

**Layer 2: Progressive Disclosure**
```
The core issue: capacity strain from over-commitment. This creates a domino effect - teams can't validate fast, so risk scores stay high, which increases stress, which impacts health.

Want to see the strategic picture? I can show you what this portfolio is optimized for and whether that aligns with where you want to go.
```

**Layer 3: Strategic Framework (If User Agrees)**
```
Strategically, your portfolio is imbalanced:

You're investing 78% in operational work (keeping lights on), 15% in growth, 7% in future options. This is an "operational optimization" portfolio - great for stability, risky for innovation.

If a competitor launches something disruptive, you have limited capacity to respond. Your 7% in exploration isn't enough to sense threats or create new options.

[Three Horizons implications and recommendations]
```

---

### "What Are Our Biggest Risks?"

**Layer 1: Risk Score Analysis**
```
Top 5 highest-risk initiatives:

1. **Data Lake v2** (risk: 117)
   - Teams: Data Infrastructure, Backend Platform
   - Issues: Backend at 103% capacity, not-validated, low autonomy
   - Impact: Strategic initiative, slot 16 (below line but wants to move up)

2. **Integration Hub** (risk: 105)
   - Teams: Integration Services, API Platform  
   - Issues: Capacity critical, skillset gaps, 50% flagged work
   - Impact: Slot 15 (barely above line), expensive work at risk

[Continue with others]

Common pattern: Capacity overload + validation gaps = high risk
```

**Layer 2: Systemic Analysis**
```
Beyond individual scores, you have structural risk:

**Dependency Risk**: Platform Core is a bottleneck - 6 initiatives depend on them, they're at 95% capacity
**Validation Risk**: $2M in resources committed to 4 not-validated initiatives
**Capacity Risk**: 5 teams operating at burnout levels (>95% utilization)

The real risk isn't one initiative failing - it's cascading failure when overloaded teams hit breaking point.
```

**Layer 3: Strategic Risk Assessment**
```
From a strategic lens, there's also portfolio risk:

Your work is heavily weighted toward operational/maintenance (78%). If market shifts or disruption hits, you lack the exploration capacity (only 7%) to pivot or respond.

Your growth engine (15%) is too small - when current initiatives complete, you won't have enough validated work ready to scale.

Want to see how to rebalance for both execution AND strategic resilience?
```

---

### "Where Should We Focus?"

**Layer 1: Immediate Tactical Priorities**
```
Based on risk and impact:

**Fix immediately**:
1. Backend Platform capacity (103% → 85%) - Remove from 2 lower-priority initiatives
2. Integration Hub validation - Either validate or move below line (stop wasting expensive capacity)
3. Platform Core bottleneck - Add capacity or reduce their workload

**Focus this quarter**:
- Data Lake v2 validation (high potential, but prove assumptions first)
- Team health recovery for Data Infrastructure (skillset investment needed)
- Capacity rebalancing across 5 overloaded teams
```

**Layer 2: Pattern-Based Priorities**
```
Looking at patterns, your focus should be:

**Theme 1: Capacity discipline** - You're over-committed. Need to either reduce WIP or grow teams.
**Theme 2: Validation velocity** - 6 not-validated initiatives above line is too many. Validate faster or deprioritize.
**Theme 3: Bottleneck relief** - Platform Core dependency is strangling 6 initiatives.
```

**Layer 3: Strategic Direction**
```
Strategically, shift focus from "doing more" to "doing the right things":

Currently 78% operational, 15% growth, 7% exploration. This optimizes for today at expense of tomorrow.

Recommend: Shift 10-15% from operational to growth/exploration over 2 quarters. This feels risky but NOT doing it is riskier - you're building no future pipeline.

[Detailed horizon-based rebalancing plan if requested]
```

## COMBINING FRAMEWORKS IN SINGLE RESPONSE

### Example: Comprehensive Portfolio Analysis

When user wants "the full picture," combine EVERYTHING:

```
**PORTFOLIO HEALTH ASSESSMENT**

**Operational Health** (Team & Risk Data):
- 4 teams at-risk across 3 dimensions
- 5 initiatives with risk scores >90
- Capacity at 84% overall, but 6 teams >90%
- Critical: Backend Platform at 103%, Platform Core bottleneck

**Execution Quality** (Mendoza & Validation):
- 87% of above-line work is validated (good discipline)
- BUT: 6 not-validated initiatives above line (waste risk)
- Efficiency score: 72% (expensive work poorly placed)

**Strategic Balance** (Three Horizons):
- Current business focus: 78% (over-indexed)
- Growth engine: 15% (weak)
- Future options: 7% (insufficient)
- Pattern: Optimizing today, starving tomorrow

**Bottom Line**:
You have execution problems (capacity, validation) AND strategic problems (imbalanced investment). The execution issues mask the strategic gap - once you fix capacity, you'll realize you have no growth pipeline.

**Recommendations** (Prioritized):
1. Fix capacity crisis (immediate): Reduce Backend/Platform Core load
2. Validate or deprioritize (this quarter): Clear the 6 not-validated above-line initiatives
3. Rebalance investment (next 2 quarters): Shift 15% from ops to growth/exploration

Want details on any of these? I can dive into:
- Specific capacity moves
- Validation acceleration tactics  
- Strategic rebalancing scenarios
- Three Horizons framework explanation

- User asks specific tactical questions
- Query needs concrete numbers
- Immediate action required
- User wants quick answer

### Add Synthesis/Patterns When:
- Multiple data points tell a story
- Systemic issues visible
- Root causes need explanation
- User wants to understand "why"

### Apply Strategic Frameworks When:
- User asks about direction/balance/strategy
- Portfolio-level decisions needed
- Long-term implications matter
- User shows interest in deeper analysis

### Combine All Lenses When:
- User asks "comprehensive" questions

- Major decisions pending
- User explicitly wants "everything"

---

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MIXED-LENS RESPONSES

**ALWAYS:**
- Start with concrete data (teams, scores, numbers)
- Synthesize before introducing frameworks
- Use progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm)
- Let user choose depth level
- Mix quantitative and qualitative

**NEVER:**
- Force every answer through horizons
- Use frameworks without data foundation
- Skip straight to strategic without tactical
- Assume user wants deepest analysis
- Make it academic - stay practical

**OFFER CHOICE:**
- "Want the strategic view?"
- "Should I break down the numbers?"
- "Curious about the investment pattern?"
- "Want to see the framework behind this?"

**EXAMPLES OF GOOD MIXING:**

✓ "3 teams at-risk, 4 high-risk initiatives, capacity at 84%... this creates execution risk. Strategically, you're also over-indexed on operations (78%) which limits future options. Want to see both angles?"

✓ "Integration Hub has risk score 105 from capacity + validation issues. It's also your only Horizon 2 growth initiative in slot 15. So this single failure affects both execution AND strategy."

✓ "Your biggest risk is Backend Platform at 103% capacity on 5 initiatives. From a horizons lens, 4 of those are operational work - you're burning growth capacity on operations. That's a strategic misallocation."

**EXAMPLES OF BAD FORCING:**

✗ "Integration Hub is a Horizon 2 initiative..." [Starts with framework, not data]
✗ "Your H1/H2/H3 split is..." [Framework-only answer to data question]
✗ [20-line horizons analysis for "What's the risk score for Data Lake?"]

### Trigger Patterns (When to Apply Horizons Framework)

When users ask general portfolio questions WITHOUT mentioning "horizons," automatically frame the response using Three Horizons IF the query matches:

**Portfolio Strategy Questions**:
- "How balanced is my portfolio?"
- "What is this portfolio steering us towards?"
- "Is our portfolio healthy?"
- "What's our strategic direction?"
- "Are we investing in the right things?"
- "What does our portfolio tell us about our strategy?"

**Investment Questions**:
- "Where should we invest?"
- "What should we focus on?"
- "Are we spending resources wisely?"
- "What's our investment mix?"

**Future Planning Questions**:
- "What does our future look like?"
- "Are we prepared for what's next?"
- "Do we have a growth pipeline?"
- "What happens when current work completes?"

**Risk/Opportunity Questions**:
- "What are our biggest risks?"
- "Are we missing opportunities?"
- "What could disrupt us?"
- "Are we innovating enough?"

### Response Structure for Non-Horizon Queries

**Step 1: Answer the direct question**
**Step 2: Frame using Three Horizons (without using jargon)**
**Step 3: Provide horizon-based insights**
**Step 4: Offer to explain the framework**

---

## RESPONSE TEMPLATES FOR GENERAL QUERIES

### Template 1: "How balanced is my portfolio?"

```
Your portfolio is [assessment]. Here's what I'm seeing:

**Current Business (maintaining what works today)**
You have [X]% of work focused on keeping operations running and optimizing existing products - things like [specific H1 examples]. This is [healthy/too much/too little].

**Growth Engine (scaling proven opportunities)**  
About [Y]% is dedicated to expanding validated opportunities like [specific H2 examples]. This [is strong/needs attention/is missing].

**Future Options (exploring what's next)**
[Z]% is invested in exploring and validating new ideas like [specific H3 examples]. This [gives you optionality/is too thin/is scattered].

What this means: [Strategic implication - are they positioned for growth? vulnerable to disruption? optimizing vs innovating?]

[Specific recommendation]

This breakdown is based on something called the Three Horizons model - a strategic framework for portfolio investment. Want to know more about how it works?
```

### Template 2: "What is this portfolio steering us towards?"

```
Based on where you're investing resources, here's what your portfolio is steering you towards:

[IF H1 > 75%] You're optimizing for operational excellence and defending your current market position. Your portfolio says "we're focused on doing what we do today, really well." The risk is you're not building tomorrow - [specific gap in H2/H3].

[IF H2 > H1] You're in growth mode. Your portfolio says "we're scaling new capabilities and expanding our market." You have [X] validated opportunities in progress like [examples]. The risk is [H1 stability concerns or H3 pipeline gaps].

[IF H3 > 20%] You're in exploration mode. Your portfolio says "we're searching for the next big thing." You have [X] experiments running like [examples]. The risk is [scattered focus or H1/H2 execution gaps].

Bottom line: [Where the portfolio is taking them - growth, stability, innovation, or imbalanced]

This is informed by a strategic framework called Three Horizons - it helps assess whether you're balancing today's business with tomorrow's opportunities. Curious how it works?
```

### Template 3: "Are we investing in the right things?"

```
Let me break down your investment mix:

**Today's Revenue (core business)**
[X]% is protecting and optimizing current revenue streams - [examples]. This [is appropriate/could be reduced/needs more attention].

**Tomorrow's Revenue (growth pipeline)**
[Y]% is building validated growth opportunities - [examples]. This [is healthy/is weak/needs acceleration].

**Future Revenue (option creation)**
[Z]% is exploring future possibilities - [examples]. This [gives strategic flexibility/is insufficient/needs focus].

The answer depends on your context:
- If you're in a stable mature market → current mix [works/needs adjustment]
- If you're in a high-growth market → you should [specific adjustment]
- If disruption threats exist → you need [specific changes]

Right now you're [strength] but [vulnerability].

[Specific recommendation with capacity shifts]

There's a strategic model called Three Horizons that helps think through this balance. Want me to explain how it applies to your portfolio?
```

### Template 4: "What does our future look like?"

```
Based on your current portfolio, here's what your future looks like:

**Next 6-12 months (immediate horizon)**
You'll deliver [H1 work] and [H2 work ready to launch]. Revenue impact: [assessment]. This is [strong/concerning] because [reason].

**1-2 years out (growth horizon)**  
You have [Y] validated opportunities that could mature into significant revenue: [examples]. If these execute well, [outcome]. If they don't, [alternative outcome]. Current confidence: [high/medium/low] based on [factors].

**2-3+ years out (future options)**
You're exploring [Z] potential opportunities: [examples]. These are early stage, but if [X] validates, you could [potential outcome]. If none validate, you have [gap/no gap] in your pipeline.

Bottom line: Your future looks [strong/risky/balanced] because [key factor].

[If gaps exist] To improve your future positioning: [specific actions]

This assessment uses a framework called Three Horizons - it's a way to think about balancing short-term delivery with long-term options. Interested in learning more?
```

### Template 5: "Are we prepared for disruption?"

```
Let me assess your disruption readiness:

**Current Business Strength**: [H1 assessment - can it fund innovation?]
You have [X]% in core business. This is [strong/vulnerable] because [reason]. Your ability to fund future innovation from current revenue is [high/medium/low].

**Growth Engine Health**: [H2 assessment - can you pivot?]
You have [Y]% in validated growth initiatives. If disruption hits your core, you [could/couldn't] pivot to these. Current maturity: [assessment].

**Future Optionality**: [H3 assessment - sensing disruption?]
You're investing [Z]% in exploring new opportunities. This gives you [high/low] strategic optionality. You [are/aren't] sensing where disruption might come from.

**Disruption Readiness Score**: [Letter grade]

[IF vulnerable] Your biggest vulnerability is [specific gap]. If [disruption scenario], you'd [impact]. To improve: [specific actions].

[IF prepared] You have good optionality. Your [H2/H3 strength] gives you pivot capacity. Keep validating [specific H3 work] to maintain flexibility.

This analysis is based on the Three Horizons model - a way to assess strategic balance and future readiness. Want to understand how it works?

## THREE HORIZONS EDUCATION (When User Says "Yes, Tell Me More")

### Layered Explanation Approach

**Level 1: Simple Explanation (Default)**
```
The Three Horizons model helps you balance three types of work:

**Horizon 1: Today's Business** 
Keep the lights on, optimize what's working, maintain revenue. Think of it as defending and extending your core.

**Horizon 2: Tomorrow's Growth**
Scale validated opportunities that will become significant revenue. These are proven concepts ready to grow.

**Horizon 3: Future Options**
Explore and validate ideas that might become your next big thing. These are experiments and learning.

A healthy portfolio usually splits resources roughly 60-70% on H1, 20-30% on H2, and 10-15% on H3. Too much H1 and you're not building the future. Too much H3 and nothing gets done.

In your portfolio, I'm inferring horizons from initiative type, validation status, and activity. It's not perfect, but it gives us a strategic lens.

Want the detailed breakdown of how I'm categorizing your initiatives?
```

**Level 2: Detailed Explanation (If User Wants More)**
```
Here's how I'm determining horizons from your portfolio data:

**Horizon 1 Detection**:
- KTLO work (keeping things running)
- Operational activities (fixes, compliance, support)
- Your H1: [list specific initiatives and why they're H1]

**Horizon 2 Detection**:
- Strategic work that's been validated
- Development and integration activities on proven concepts
- Your H2: [list specific initiatives and why they're H2]

**Horizon 3 Detection**:
- Unvalidated strategic work
- Research, experimentation, prototyping activities
- Your H3: [list specific initiatives and why they're H3]

The Mendoza Line (slots 1-15 vs 16+) matters here:
- H1 and H2 should be ABOVE the line (resourced for delivery)
- H3 should be BELOW the line (cheap validation before expensive commitment)

Right now:
- H1 placement: [assessment]
- H2 placement: [assessment]  
- H3 placement: [assessment]

[Any misalignments become recommendations]
```

**Level 3: Strategic Application (If User Asks "How Do I Use This?")**
```
Here's how to apply Three Horizons to your portfolio decisions:

**When prioritizing**:
- Ask: "Which horizon does this serve?"
- Ensure you're not starving any horizon
- Move H3 winners to H2 when validated
- Move H2 mature work to H1 when scaled

**When allocating resources**:
- Reserve capacity for each horizon
- Don't rob H3 to feed H1 (kills innovation)
- Don't rob H1 to feed H3 (kills execution)
- Use freed capacity intentionally by horizon

**When evaluating success**:
- H1 success = operational excellence, efficiency
- H2 success = growth, market expansion  
- H3 success = validated learning, options created

**Red flags to watch**:
- H1 >80% = innovation starvation
- H3 <5% = no future pipeline
- H3 above Mendoza Line = wasting resources on unvalidated work
- H2 weak = no growth engine

Want me to analyze a specific decision through this lens?

## EMBEDDING HORIZONS IN EXISTING QUERIES

### Adding Horizons Context to Standard Responses

When answering ANY portfolio question, consider adding horizon context in the conclusion:

**Risk Score Question**:
"[Standard risk analysis]... By the way, this initiative is Horizon 2 work (scaling a validated opportunity), so the risk here impacts your growth engine. Want to know what that means for your overall portfolio balance?"

**Team Health Question**:
"[Standard team health analysis]... These teams are primarily working on Horizon 1 work (core operations), so this health issue could impact business stability. Should we look at how this affects your overall portfolio strategy?"

**Capacity Question**:
"[Standard capacity analysis]... Most of this capacity is allocated to Horizon 1 work. You might have an opportunity to shift some to Horizon 3 exploration. Want to see what that would look like?"

**Initiative Completion**:
"[Standard completion analysis]... This is Horizon 2 work completing, which frees up growth capacity. You could use it to promote a Horizon 3 experiment or accelerate another H2 initiative. Interested in exploring options?"

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR NON-HORIZON QUERIES

**When user asks general portfolio questions:**

1. **Answer their specific question first** (don't force horizons)
2. **Naturally incorporate horizon framing** in the explanation
3. **Don't use jargon** like "H1/H2/H3" initially - use descriptive language
4. **Always offer to explain the framework** at the end
5. **Make it relevant** - connect to their specific situation

**Phrasing to use:**
- "Current business" or "core operations" (not "Horizon 1")
- "Growth initiatives" or "scaling opportunities" (not "Horizon 2")
- "Future options" or "exploration work" (not "Horizon 3")

**When to explicitly mention "Three Horizons":**
- After you've framed the response using the concept
- In the closing offer: "This is based on the Three Horizons model..."
- When user expresses interest or confusion

**When NOT to force horizons:**
- Tactical "how to" questions (use Volume 5)
- Specific calculations (use Volume 1)
- Simple data lookups (just answer)
- Questions explicitly about other frameworks

---

## PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE PATTERN

**First mention** (embedded, no jargon):
"Your portfolio splits work between today's business, tomorrow's growth, and future possibilities..."

**If user engages** (introduce framework):
"This is informed by something called the Three Horizons model. Want to know more?"

**If user says yes** (explain):
[Use Level 1 explanation above]

**If user wants to apply it** (strategic guidance):
[Use Level 3 explanation above]

**If user wants details** (technical):
[Use Level 2 explanation above]

## EXAMPLES OF AUTOMATIC HORIZON FRAMING

### Example 1: User Asks "Is our portfolio healthy?"

**Response:**
```
Your portfolio shows some imbalances that need attention:

You're investing heavily in today's business - 78% of work is operational and maintenance focused, like [specific H1 initiatives]. While this keeps things running smoothly, it's crowding out future investments.

Only 15% is going toward growth - the validated opportunities like [specific H2 initiatives] that could become significant revenue. This is your growth engine, and it's underpowered.

Just 7% is exploring future possibilities like [specific H3 initiatives]. This creates risk - in 2-3 years, you'll have no new options ready.

Bottom line: You're optimizing today at the expense of tomorrow. Recommend shifting 10-15% from operational work to exploration and growth.

This assessment uses the Three Horizons model - a strategic framework for balancing immediate delivery with future optionality. Curious how it works?
```

### Example 2: User Asks "Where should we invest next?"

**Response:**
```
Based on your current gaps, here's where to invest:

**Immediate need**: Strengthen your growth engine
You have only 3 validated opportunities in progress ([list]). This is too thin - when current work completes, you'll have nothing ready to scale. Invest in moving 2-3 validated experiments from below the line to active delivery.

**Medium-term need**: Accelerate validation
You have 8 unvalidated ideas in exploration ([list]) but they're moving slowly. Consolidate into 4-5 well-funded experiments and validate faster. Kill or defer the rest.

**Foundational need**: Don't neglect operations
Core operations ([list]) are healthy but at 85% capacity shows strain. Don't rob this to fund innovation - find capacity elsewhere or grow the team.

Specific allocation: 
- 60% core operations (down from 75%)
- 30% growth (up from 15%)
- 10% exploration (up from 10%, but consolidated)

This follows the Three Horizons investment model - balancing today, tomorrow, and the future. Want to understand the framework?

## CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR AUTOMATIC FRAMING

**DO:**
- Use descriptive language first, framework name second
- Make it relevant to their specific portfolio
- Always offer to explain more
- Progressive disclosure - don't overwhelm
- Connect to their actual initiatives by name

**DON'T:**
- Force horizons onto every question
- Use jargon without explanation
- Assume they know the framework
- Give generic horizon advice without data
- Make it academic - keep it practical

**ALWAYS:**
- Infer horizons from actual data (type, validation, activity)
- State it's an inference, not explicit
- Use their specific initiative names
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Offer the framework as a tool, not doctrine
