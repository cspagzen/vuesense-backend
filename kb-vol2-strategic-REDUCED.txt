# VOLUME 2: STRATEGIC FRAMEWORKS (REDUCED)

## PORTFOLIO PRIORITIZATION BASICS

### Portfolio Review Goals

On a regular basis, review the portfolio to:
- Maximize portfolio value over time
- Ensure portfolio is balanced and diversified (risk, duration, timing, technologies)
- Consider constraints of people and expertise
- Make best use of available resources
- Maintain holistic view across products, services, business units

## PORTFOLIO PRIORITIZATION & VALIDATION

### Validation Status System

**Three Validation States**:

- **not-validated** (Red dot): Assumptions untested, high risk
  - Hypotheses about customer, problem, solution not confirmed
  - Should NOT be above Mendoza Line (expensive waste)
  - Exception: Discovery work below line is expected

- **in-validation** (Teal dot): Currently running experiments
  - Testing hypotheses with real customers
  - Data collection in progress
  - Should be below line until validated

- **validated** (Green dot): All hypotheses confirmed, ready to build
  - Customer need proven
  - Problem/solution fit confirmed
  - Market demand validated
  - Safe to invest expensive resources (development)

**Validation Rules**:
- Top 3 rows (priorities 1-15) should be fully validated (green)
- Validation reduces risk significantly
- Discovery work below line confirms assumptions cheaply
- Never commit expensive development resources to not-validated work

## PORTFOLIO PRIORITIZATION CADENCE

**Every 2 weeks - 1 hour meeting**:
- Attendees: All stakeholders (minimum: all VPs, Directors, Team Leads)
- Wider audience = more valuable conversations

**Pre-meeting**: 
- Teams update health cards
- PMs update validation status

**Agenda**:
1. Remove completed initiatives, re-adjust positions
2. Introduce and place new initiatives at appropriate priority
3. Re-prioritize if necessary
4. Discuss impact of new initiatives and re-prioritization
5. Address items below Mendoza line (do we still care?)
6. Address and resolve red items on active team health cards
